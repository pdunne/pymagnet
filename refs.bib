  abstract = {Covering basic physical concepts, experimental methods, and applications, this book is an indispensable text on the fascinating science of magnetism, and an invaluable source of practical reference data. Accessible, authoritative, and assuming undergraduate familiarity with quantum mechanics, electromagnetism and vectors, this textbook can be used on graduate courses. Emphasis is placed on practical calculations and numerical magnitudes - from nanoscale to astronomical scale - with a focus on modern manifestations, including spin electronic devices. Each self-contained chapter begins with a summary, and ends with exercises and further reading. The book is thoroughly illustrated with over 600 figures to help convey concepts and clearly explain ideas. Easily digestible tables and data sheets provide a wealth of useful information on magnetic materials, and 38 principal magnetic materials, and many more related compounds, are treated in detail.},

Homogeneity is better than 1\% of maximum in a region of diameter 7 mm or 3.5 mm at maximum and zero field, respectively},

Simulations illustrate the stable regions for levitation above the permanent magnets; and a novel eight-block configuration is proposed, which allows denser materials such as gold or lead to be levitated.},

  abstract = {Metal electrodeposition reflects the pattern of the magnetic field at the cathode surface created by a magnet array. For deposits from paramagnetic cations such as Co2+ or Cu2+, the effect is explained in terms of magnetic pressure which modifies the thickness of the diffusion layer, that governs their mass transport. An inverse effect allows deposits to be structured in complementary patterns when a strongly paramagnetic but nonelectroactive cation such as Dy3+ is present in the electrolyte, and is related to inhibition of convection of water liberated at the cathode, in the inhomogeneous magnetic field. The magnetic structuring depends on the susceptibility of the electroactive species relative to that of the nonelectroactive background.},

  abstract = {In basic science areas, such as semiconductor physics, superconductivity, structural biology, and chemistry, magnetic fields are used as a powerful tool for analysis of matter because they can change the physical state of a system. In the presence of a magnetic field, the angular momenta (spins), the orbital motion of charged particles, and therefore the energy of the investigated physical system, are altered.Wemust realize, however, that the size of the induced effects are very modest compared to other physical quantities. One Bohr magneton (typical range of atomic magnetic moments) in a magnetic field of 10 tesla (T) (a 10 T field is {$\sim$}200,000 times the strength of the earth's magnetic field) has an energy of 0.58 meV, corresponding to a temperature of 6.7 K, a small value in comparison to room temperature. On the other hand, the generation of a magnetic field of 10Talready requires a noticeable engineering effort, with continuous fields of 50 T being the upper limit of what can be achieved today. Pulsed magnetic fields can be generated up to 100 T for durations in the millisecond range, and up to 1000 T on the microsecond time scale. Therefore, experiments must be chosen judiciously. Very often, a low-noise sample environment, such as low mechanical vibrations, small field fluctuations (in the case of dc fields), and low temperatures are decisive to the success of scientific measurements in magnetic fields.},
